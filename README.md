# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Sreeram Mandava**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ yes ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ yes ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ yes ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ yes ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ yes ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ yes ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ yes ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ yes ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ yes ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ yes ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ yes ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ yes ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ yes ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ yes ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-animated-countdown-timer-with-html-css-and-javascript/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[When implementing the requirements of the prework assignment, the challenges I encountered differentiated
from the typical tribulations I faced in coding projects. For example, as I could only devote limited time 
to the project, I realized that my work required meticulous time management to handle my time 
studying for exams and completing this assignment. Therefore, differentiating from how I usually write code, 
I implemented minimal code to reduce the amount of time I needed to complete the project; additionally, as 
I typically wrote code to handle distinctive situations through numerous if statements, I wrote code based on 
redundancy and handling more vague issues, since this achieved efficiency and would reduce the time I exhausted.
Along with this, as my issues in coding could usually be resolved by looking at error messages in my compiler for VScode, 
I was intrigued by the implementations of JavaScript and CSS permitting my code to run erroneously. Therefore, 
inspired by my professor who often utilized breaks and continues to resolve issues in MATLAB, I implemented console 
logs and breaks in JavaScript to study and identify tribulations in my code. Thereby, if I noticed that some console 
logs were not being utilized or printing at a different time, I discovered that I could identify like a compiler 
the general area where my code has a fallacy. Through this method, I cultivated a comprehension of call sequences
and general functionality utilized in JavaScript. Furthermore, as most of my issues were associated with the clock
feature, I discovered the console logs allowed me visually to conceptualize how the documentation noted the clock 
to be implemented. Conclusively, my tribulations of time management and the lack of a visible compiler provided me 
with the ability to comprehend coding in an inculcating way. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[When persisting through the project, I noticed how the implementations of the prework assignment often
encompassed working on the user inputs and aggregation of that specific data for the game. Thereby, since 
I was able to do this by myself, I wanted to know how the actual implementation of frontend and backend 
programming works, since I found that these two jobs seem distinctive when the work felt very integrated. 
Aside from this, as the project was oriented closely with software, I wanted to know how web development 
takes into effect products that require hardware to generate user inputs instead of just software. While 
I do not expect the program to explicitly structure teachings on hardware, it would be interesting to 
identify how web development handles software that is compatible with hardware. Therefore, these are the 
questions I would desire to be answered if I am selected into the program.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Impressed by features of my clock system, I would desire to cultivate and expand on its implementations to 
improve it. As my project’s noticeable features derive from the mistake counter and the clock system, I would 
utilize my extra hours to integrate these features by implementing the clock system to account for mistakes the 
user generates; for example, if the person gets an answered marked incorrectly, my clock system would immediately
deduct 5 seconds from the allotted time. Additionally, as the clock feature provides duress to the user, I would 
expand on my knowledge of tonal systems in JavaScript by construct a ticking sound in a certain time frame to 
produce further stress for the user. Furthermore, while I do not possess extensive knowledge on CSS and JavaScript,
I would augment my generated clock’s appearance with the provided CSS guide by changing its strokes, positioning
on the page, and overall design; ideally, this would establish better legibility and originality in my project to
represent my design conceptualizations instead of relying mainly on others’. Thereby, as my changes are oriented 
towards the clock system, I would enhance that feature to become an integral part of the game and instrumental into
how the user generates inputs that affect the game.]
